# 3 Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/
## Solution
This problem follows the Two Pointers pattern and shares similarities with Pair with Target Sum. A couple of differences are that the input array is not sorted and instead of a pair we need to find triplets with a target sum of zero.

To follow a similar approach, first, we will sort the array and then iterate through it taking one number at a time. Let’s say during our iteration we are at number ‘X’, so we need to find ‘Y’ and ‘Z’ such that X + Y + Z == 0. At this stage, our problem translates into finding a pair whose sum is equal to “-X” (as from the above equation Y + Z == -X).

Another difference from Pair with Target Sum is that we need to find all the unique triplets. To handle this, we have to skip any duplicate number. Since we will be sorting the array, so all the duplicate numbers will be next to each other and are easier to skip.

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun threeSum(nums: IntArray): List<List<Int>> {
        nums.sort()
        val result = mutableListOf<List<Int>>()
        for (i in 0 until nums.size - 2) {
            if (i == 0 || nums[i - 1] != nums[i]) {
                result.addAll(twoSumPlusKEqualZero(nums, nums[i], i + 1, nums.size - 1))
            }
        }
        return result
    }

    fun twoSumPlusKEqualZero(nums: IntArray, k: Int, start: Int, end: Int): List<List<Int>> {
        val result = mutableListOf<List<Int>>()
        var s = start
        var e = end
        while (s < e) {
            val sum = nums[s] + nums[e] 
            if (sum < -k) s++
            else if (sum > -k) e--
            else {
                result.add(listOf(k, nums[s++], nums[e--]))
                while (s < e && nums[s - 1] == nums[s]) s++
                while (s < e && nums[e + 1] == nums[e]) e--
            }
        }
        return result
    }
}

## Complexity
### Time
sort is `O(n log n)` and our helper function is `O(n)` we have to call it n times so that makes our algorithm `O(n log n + n^2)` which is asymtotically equivalent to `O(n^2)`.
### Space
`O(n)` needed for sorting if we don't consider the output arrays
